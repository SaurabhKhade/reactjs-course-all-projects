# reactjs-course-all-projects

this is description of each react app above in sequence as they are uploaded.

1. Dynamic Greeting App:

   my first project in rectjs learning journey
   
   a simple dynamic greeting app which greets as per the the time in local system as given below
   
   => 'Good Morning' in between 3AM to 12PM in color (rgb(243,148,0))
   
   => 'Good Afternoon' in between 12 PM to 4PM in color rgb(255,196,38))
   
   => 'Good Evening in between 4PM to 12AM in color rgb(164,255,234))
   
   => 'Good Night' in between 12AM to 3AM in color rgb(255,170,236))
   

2. Netflix Series:

   my second project in reactjs learning journey
   
   a simple app which shows six netflix series and there posters. This project is just to learn about react components. And only thing i want to mention about it is the button below each card just redirect you to https://www.google.com/ and not to the actual series.
   
3. Netflix Serieses Updated:

   it is just a updated version of previous project which is Netflix Serieses. In this i have used flat arrow functions wherever i can. and also improved the style (css) and yes, now description of each series is real and also button redirect you to appropriate series on netflix.
   
   But the main reason to upload this as another project is, now i have learned how to use the loops in react while using JSX. so which i have hardcoded in previous project, is now rendered using loop.
   
4. Slot Machine:
 
   my third 4th project (basically its 3rd but i am considering both Netflix Serieses as separate) in reactjs learning journey.

   it is just a hardcoded slot machine. It is hardcoded because i have created it only to practice if-else statements in react. And in next projects i will update it to fully functional slot machine :)

5. Get Current Time:

   its my 5th project (mini mini project).
 
   This is just a very very simple react app which shows current time of device when clicked on Get Time named button. Main reason behind this app is its introduction to hooks in reactjs. I have used hooks concept to show the current time when clicked on Get Time button.
