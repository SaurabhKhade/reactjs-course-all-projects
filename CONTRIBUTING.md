If anyone is contributing in this repository, then my humble request is if you are going to update anything, please update design (css) or basic html. Please don't add any high level reactjs as this projects are just to learn reactjs and it will help me in future to understand how i learn all reactjs. So, if you going to update anything you are free, but please don't update reactjs. :)
